# Templates


## Remote templates

A "remote template" is a template that is hosted separately in a git repository.
It allows many project to reuse the same template.

To write a remote template, just write a normal template inside a directory (so read below).
Then publish that directory on GitHub (for example).

Layout example:

```
my-template/
    style.css
    default.twig
    README.md # explain how to install your template
```

Here are some examples of templates:

- [MyCLabs template](https://github.com/myclabs/couscous-template)


## Local templates

Templates contain Twig layouts and assets (javascripts, cssâ€¦). They should be inside `website` directory (or whatever you named it).

The default Twig layout that is used for rendering the pages is named `default.twig`.

Example of a `default.twig`:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <title>My project!</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        {% block content %}

            {{ content|raw }}

        {% endblock %}
    </body>
</html>
```

If, for example, you want your home page to have a different layout, you can write a `home.twig`
that overrides `default.twig`:

```html
{% extends "default.twig" %}

{% block content %}
    <h1>This is the home page!</h1>

    {{ content|raw }}
{% endblock %}
```

You can set your `README.md` (i.e. your home page) to use that layout using YAML Front matter in the Markdown file:

```markdown
---
layout: home
---
This is my documentation.

## Subtitle

This is a *sub-chapter*.
```

**Good to know: any variable you put in the YAML Front matter is accessible in the view,**
just like with `couscous.yml` (and you can override values from `couscous.yml`).

Example:

```markdown
---
layout: home
myVar: true
myOtherVar: "Some string"
---
This is my documentation.
```


## Links

To ensure all your links are working correctly, you should define a `baseUrl` in `configuration.yml`
(see [the configuration documentation](configuration.md)).

Then you can use it in the layouts:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <body>

        <ul class="menu">
            <li>
                <a href="{{ baseUrl }}/doc/my-sub-article.md">Sub-article</a>
            </li>
        </ul>

        {% block content %}

            {{ content|raw }}

        {% endblock %}
    </body>
</html>
```

All your Markdown links should be rewritten and work. However, make sure you write relative links.
A good rule of thumb is: if it works on GitHub.com, it will work with Couscous.

## Bower

If a `bower.json` file is present in the `website/` directory, dependencies will be
installed automatically.

You don't need to have Bower installed on your machine, Couscous internally uses
[BowerPHP](http://bowerphp.org/).
