# Couscous

Couscous is great. Couscous generates a website from your markdown documentation.


## Introduction

[Github pages](http://pages.github.com/) are good, but what do you do:

* if you want to write your documentation in **Markdown** and not in HTML?
* if you want your documentation to be transformed into a **website**?
* if you want to **keep the documentation with your code**, versioned in the repository?

*Couscous* is here to help you. **Your documentation is written in Markdown,
versioned in your repository with your source, compiled to HTML and published to *Github pages*.**


## How does it work

1. you write your README and documentation in `.md` files (Markdown) on your repository
2. you generate you website with *Couscous*
  - it turns `.md` files into HTML files
  - HTML files are committed to the `gh-pages` branch of your repository, and thus are published as a website by Github
3. profit!


## Features

* full control over the website layout: you write your own template and menus
* supports any number of pages, images, links, Javascript (in the template), â€¦
* hosted by GitHub on "Github pages", you don't have to host your website
* your README will be your home page, your code repository will always be in sync with your website
* supports GitHub fenced code blocks
* easily extensible, clean PHP code
